  <div id='text1'><a>Hi, my name is Kevin Bordonaro. <br>
  That’s not entirely true,<br>
  my full name is actually Kevin Alfonso Bordonaro<br>
  since I was born in Sicily<br>
  where you need to be named after your grandfather<br>
  or people will think badly of you.<br><br>

  Living in Sicily is really easy<br>
  because you don’t need to think about what to do:<br>
  the people around you are usually very vocal<br>
  about what they think you should do anyway. It’s also so much fun<br>
  because you get to judge everything that everyone does,<br>
  and there is no way you’re not gonna find something to criticise;<br>
  it’s crazy isn’t it?<br>
  My grandma wore black for 7 years after my grandfather died<br>
  cause she was too scared of people’s reactions,<br>
  and she’s a grown woman!<br><br>

  So picture this:
  I told my parents I like boys,<br>
  but I can’t tell my relatives because what would they think?<br>
  As soon as my uncle saw I started painting my nails <br>
  he went straight to my mother<br>
  and told her I should stop because<br>
  what would people think?<br>
  So what if I decide to be myself 24/7,<br><br>

  unapologetic and carefree,<br><br>

  living my best life without worrying about anything<br><br>

  ... what would people think?</a></div>
